# Simply In-Registry Malware
An example of malware which can live inside of the Windows registry and presistently spawn reverse shells.
Just a simple PoC, AMSI does block this by default.

# How It Works
When the `malware.reg` file is installed, a run key is placed in the registry, and the encoded shell is stored in a seperate key.
Every time the PC restarts, the powershell command will run, and a reverse shell will be called to the encoded ip address.
